# Welcome to alis.exchange playground for Go

> To open the `README.md` file in preview mode press down `⇧ + ⌘ + v` for Mac or ` shift + ctrl + v` for Windows.

This repo houses the [quickstart example](https://docs.alis.exchange/getting-started/quick-start.html) part of the **alis.exchange** documentation for Go.

We have preconfigured the development environment for you to easily make your first request without having to worry about any setup.

## Make a request using Go

1. Open up the terminal (Mac: `⌘ + j`, Windows: `ctrl + j` ) and ensure that you are in the `playground-GO` directory.

If executing this example on Gitpod, run the following command from the terminal:

```bash
$ cd playground-GO
```

2. Run the code by running the terminal command:

```bash
$ go run *.go
```

## Get a feel for the **alis.exchange** experience

Interested in trying something for yourself?

We suggest creating your own function and incorporating a request to the `BooksClient`. Some suggestions of things to try:

* Loop through all the books and print out the author.
* Get a book and wrangle the response to be printed out in a sentence structure.
* Use the response of `ListBooks` to make multiple `GetBook` requests.
